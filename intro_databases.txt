2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.
A database would be used when the data needs to be searchable/retrievable, able to be changed/amended, when multiple applications may need to assess the data, and that can live outside of the program. A text file can be used when the data is small and does not need to be manipulated in the same way, or is only used within a small program and then does not need to be accessed outside of that program.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
SQL is a declarative, rather than a procedural language.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
A database is typically a table that sorts items by row, column and value. These fit together because the columns define the type/category of the data, while each row represents an instance of the data. The table is the entire collection of data, and each single cell/value is comprised of a unique value that is that grouped with other data types as defined by the column and row.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
a. table - entire collection of data
b. Row - represents individual instances of the data (i.e. individual purchases in a checkbook)
c. column - like types of data stored together, such as ‘dates’ or ‘stores’ in the checkbook example
d. value - the specific piece of data within in each cell of the table

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.
a. string
b. object
c. integer
